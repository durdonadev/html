        <h2>Job Ready Skills</h2>
        <p>
            We have built a curriculum containing tons of learning materials to
            teach modern technologies and equip you with job-ready skills. You
            can choose a <strong>Fullstack JavaScript</strong> or a
            <strong>Frontend program </strong> . You will also get hands-on
            training in Computer Science in both programs.
        </p>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>
            Currently we are delivering Live lectures. We are also working on
            opening <em>Brooklyn</em> and <em>Chicago</em> campuses in April and
            June respectively. Completely self-paced program will be launched in
            April, 2022.
        </p>
        <h2>Career Support</h2>
        <p>
            Our goal is the same as your goals: to help you launch a career as a
            Software Engineer. <strong>A Career Advisor</strong> will work with
            each student on navigating the industry, creating a resume, curating
            a LinkedIn profile, preparing for interviews, and providing a way to
            track job applications.
